This is for create your own discord bot, so you just need to change a few things.
The discord bot uses a MySQL database, Open AI api and cogs from discord to do the next things:
 
1. Play, pause, resume and change music staying in the voice channel
2. Register users to a little economy with only coins, also equip, change, and see what mascot you have (primitive)
3. Talk with the bot
4. Show memes, curiositys, and black humor jokes

It also have a GUI for add more music, jokes, memes and mascots. In the case of music and memes, it has to be the path (just something like meme.jpg, music.mp3).
The GUI has 4 widgets, write what you want to add in the entry and click the button.
To use the bot write the commands in a text channel of the server with the prefix (below you will see how to change it) something like: !meme.

For the 1st thing the bot can do, you need to create the database table with the next code:
create table musipaths(
    id int not null auto_increment,
    musicpath varchar(255),
    primary key (id)
);

For the 2nd thing the bot can do, you need to create the database table with the next code:
create table users(
    id int not null auto_increment,
    user varchar(255),
    coins int,
    mascotaEquipada varchar(255),
    primary key (id)
);

For the 4th thing the bot can do, you need to create the database tables with the next code:

Memes:
create table memepaths(
    id int not null auto_increment,
    memepath varchar(255),
    primary key (id)
);

Curiositys:
create table curiositys(
    id int not null auto_increment,
    curiosity varchar(255),
    primary key (id)
);

Black humor jokes:
create table chistesnegros(
    id int not null auto_increment,
    chiste varchar(255),
    primary key (id)
);

Things you can change:
- Bot token: this obviusly can be changed, otherwise the bot won't run, go to main.py in "client.run()".
- Open AI api key: for change this, go to RaidenTalk class in support_classes.py and place your key in "self.api_key" atribute.
- Config file path: go to "self.path_file" atribute in curiositys, pelea_mascotas, Memes_working and music_working, DB_pymysql classes.
- Prefix: go to "command_prefix" parameter on the super().__init() of client class in main.py
- Cogs to load: if you create more cogs, add it to "self.coglist" atribute in Client class in main.py
- Config values: open the config.json file with notepad and change the values, but don't change the "values_choose" dictionary.
- The RockPaperScissors minigame answers: go to the RPS class on curiositys.py
- Name of functions in curiositys, pelea_mascotas, Memes_working and music_workinG and RPS classes: just someting like "async def pausar" to "async def pause".
- Multimedia paths: in config file, the "paths_music" and "paths_memes" can be change it, i recommend a simple path like "C:\\Songs".
